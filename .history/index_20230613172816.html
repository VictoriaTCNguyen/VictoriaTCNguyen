							<h2>Data Cleaning : Monster.com U.S. Jobs</h2>
						</header>

						<p>In this project my goal was to find and clean the messiest dataset that I could using Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

						<div class="center">
							<div class="col-4 col-12-mobile">
								
								<p> My goal for this project was to use Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to push my data cleaning abilities with the messiest 
									dataset I could find.</p>
								
								<p> After a bit of searching, I came across a webscrape on Kaggle that contained 22,000 job listings from the job board, 
									Monster.com</p>
								
								<p> The first step was identifying what kind of information I wanted from the dataset - in other words, what it would look 
									like if it were clean, then coming up ways to extract that information from what is given. </p>

								<img src="images/1a.png" alt="">

								<p>Upon initial investigation, I found that job descriptions could be found in the location and salary columns, locations 
									could be found in the organization column, some entries had the same information copied into every single column, salaries 
									were being entered as hourly wages, and some just had useless or nonsensical entries.  </p>

									<img src="images/1c.png" alt="">

								<p>The first issue I decided to tackle was the one I see most commonly in datasets: that multiple variables are being put into
									 the same column and need to be parsed into their own, proper variables. The ‘job_types’ variable had two separate ways of 
									 distinguishing jobs from each other: full time vs. part time, and contract vs. employee. Other than that, this column was 
									 nicely formatted and all I needed to do was pull the right substrings from each of them. </p>																

								<img src="images/1b.png" alt="">

								<p>Next, I tackled the locations column, which quickly proved to be the most difficult.  A good chunk of these were just entire
									 job descriptions pasted in. My first idea was to shave off unwanted entries. As far as I’m aware, most location names 
									 could be spelled out in 50 characters or less. In addition, if an entire job description was pasted into this column,
									  there would usually be a title, so I also searched for “Location:” in the longer entries. </p>

								<img src="images/1d.png" alt="">

								<p>After extracting the location from each of the job entries, I decided to pull the state & zip code from each location. </p>

								<img src="images/1e.png" alt="">

								<p>I then ran into an unexpected issue. Because state names are entered either by spelling out their full name or by their two 
									letter abbreviation, I thought I could simply search for any substring containing the abbreviated state names. However,
									 many job descriptions would use capital letters in one way or another - whether it was the entire job description being 
									 capitalized or using capitalization to emphasize whole words or titles. Either way, I had to find a way around it. Thus,
									  I used regex to find the two capital letters together with non-capital characters before and after. 
								</p>
								<img src="images/1f.png" alt="">

								<p>Now that the states were sorted, I moved onto the zipcodes. Thankfully, from the previous step, I was able to tinker with 
									a regex and similarly used one to pull strings containing five consecutive digits. This also kept me from accidentally 
									pulling any phone numbers that made it into this column. </p>

								<img src="images/1g.png" alt="">

								<p>The last bulk of my work was fixing the salary column. I had my work set out for me because I could see that it was a 
									jumble of salaries, hourly wages, vague descriptions of what their compensation might be, or just other benefits that 
									didn’t help candidates understand what pay they should be expecting. </p>

								<img src="images/1h.png" alt="">

								<p>I extracted all entries that mentioned “yearly” and “hourly”, and swapped the hourly salaries that were too outrageous
									 to be true to yearly salaries, and vice-versa. I then shaved off excess characters to get plain numbers, then converted 
									 hourly wages to salaries. </p>

								<img src="images/1i.png" alt="">

								<p> Finally, the data was ready to be analyzed.</p>

							<h2>Tableau Dashboard: Video Game Sales</h2>
						</header>
						
						<p> Video games have been a passion of mine since I was young. Even as I got older and took on more responsibilities that kept me from gaming with my 
							brothers for hours, I would still keep an eye on what games were coming out to see what we would play next. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Having played games for so long, I have basically watched the gaming landscape change around me throughout my life. I saw consoles come and go, huge 
							companies merge,
							 and trends change between different genres and monetization methods.</p>

						<p>
							Because of this, I decided I wanted to make a dashboard that almost acted like an interactive time capsule for video games.
							While it lacks the context that a full timeline could provide, this dashboard allows the user to more easily visualize how 
							video game sales for certain titles and categories compared to others during their release.
						</p>

						<p>
							To allow users to refine the results to their own interests, I made it so the dashboard could be filtered by different date 
							frames, publishers, and game genres to get a better look at what was popular during different eras, rather than just an overall look at sales.
