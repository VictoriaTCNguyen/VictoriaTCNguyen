							<h2>Data Cleaning : Monster.com U.S. Jobs</h2>
						</header>

						<p>In this project my goal was to find and clean the messiest dataset that I could using Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

						<div class="center" style = text-align:left;>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-mobile">
								<img src="Website pics/kaggle.png" alt="Image of Kaggle dataset">
								<p>The first step in this project was to actually find a messy data set. This turned out to be tougher than I thought it would. I searched far and wide for the absolute messiest dataset that I could. My search finally led me to Kaggle which hosts wide variety of datasets for anyone to use. So I found one perfect for what I needed. A webscrape of about 22,000 job listings from Monster.com.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/dfinfo.png" alt="Image of df.info">
								<p>This dataset is an absolute mess. There are job descriptions inside the location column and the salary column. There are locations inside the organization column. Some columns have the same information throught and some have comepletely useless information. There are some salaries listing over $100,000 an hour. These all need to be fixed before any analysis can be performed.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/jobtypes.png" alt="Image of job types">
								<p>The first thing I wanted to tackle was the simplest. There are multiple variables being displayed in one column which is an issue in a lot of data sets that I have seen. There are entries for both what job type the position is (i.e. Contractor or Employee) and the type of hours worked (i.e. Part Time or Full Time). Luckily this was one of the columns that was formatted somewhat nicely. So it was a matter of just looking for the right substrings to pull out the correct information.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/messyloc.png" alt="Image of messy location column">
								<p>After fixing the easiest column, then comes the hardest one. This column doesn't even look like it has locations in it at all because it is filled with so many job descriptions. The first step to cleaning this column is to start narrowing it down. Any actual locations in the column are less than 50 characters long and the locations that are in the long job descriptions are preceeded by "Location:" so that is where I started from. After pulling each location out of the job descriptions and getting each properly placed location out into a new column it was time to see what actual information I could get out of it. I decided to extract the state and zip code.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/algo.png" alt="Image of giant algorithm">
								<p>Extracting the state was a bit tricky because this column had both state names and abbreviations. Looking for the full state name wasn't a problem but looking for the state abbreviations was. I couldn't just look for any substring containing the two capital letters because there are many instances where the job descriptions are type entirely in capitals. So I had to use regex to get two capital letters with a non capital character before and after. </p>
								<img src="Website pics/states.png" alt="Image of extracted states">
								<p>After doing this it worked out nicely. Then it was on to the zip codes.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/zips.png" alt="Image of extracted zips">
								<p>In a similar fashion to before I used a regex to extract strings of 5 numbers in a row. Using regex was once again required due to the fact that there were full phone numbers in the location column. After getting the states and zip codes out of the location column I had to do the exact same thing to the organization column.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/messysalary.png" alt="Image of salaries">
								<p>The last big part of this dataset cleaning was the salary column. This column is completely filled with useless and also incorrect information.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/yearhoursalary.png" alt="Image of salaries per year and hour">
								<p>A number in the salary column is useless unless it tells us what that number represents so I extracted every entry that said if it was a yearly or hourly salary. After that I changed every entry that was just obviously incorrect. Every yearly salary under $200 and every hourly salary over $200 were swapped.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/cleansalary.png" alt="Image of salaries with just numbers">
								<p>Once all numbers seemed to be correct it was on to getting rid of the fluff. That was just a matter of removing excess characters and getting the raw number. After that I took all hourly salaries and multiplied them by the hours worked from the hours column from earler. If the hours column had a null value then I just assumed full time.</p>
								<img src="Website pics/finalsheet.png" alt="Image of final sheet">
								<p>Now the sheet is cleaned and ready for analysis!</p>

								My name is Victoria Nguyen. Data analysis and vizualition are just two of the many things I'm passionate about. 
								Whether I'm using spreadsheets to optimize my workout routine or using it to observe consumer habits, I love using data to enhance the way I look at the world.

							<p>
								Outside of data analytics, I love to travel, cook, discuss all things media, play video games,
								 & live an active lifestyle.
