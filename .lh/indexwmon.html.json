The ‘job_types’ variable had two separate ways of \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t distinguishing jobs from each other: full time vs. part time, and contract vs. employee. Other than that, this column was \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t nicely formatted and all I needed to do was pull the right substrings from each of them. </p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/1b.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Next, I tackled the locations column, which quickly proved to be the most difficult.  A good chunk of these were just entire\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t job descriptions pasted in. My first idea was to shave off unwanted entries. As far as I’m aware, most location names \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t could be spelled out in 50 characters or less. In addition, if an entire job description was pasted into this column,\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  there would usually be a title, so I also searched for “Location:” in the longer entries. </p>\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/1d.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>After extracting the location from each of the job entries, I decided to pull the state & zip code from each location. </p>\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/1e.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I then ran into an unexpected issue. Because state names are entered either by spelling out their full name or by their two \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tletter abbreviation, I thought I could simply search for any substring containing the abbreviated state names. However,\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t many job descriptions would use capital letters in one way or another - whether it was the entire job description being \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t capitalized or using capitalization to emphasize whole words or titles. Either way, I had to find a way around it. Thus,\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  I used regex to find the two capital letters together with non-capital characters before and after. \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/1f.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Now that the states were sorted, I moved onto the zipcodes. Thankfully, from the previous step, I was able to tinker with \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta regex and similarly used one to pull strings containing five consecutive digits. This also kept me from accidentally \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpulling any phone numbers that made it into this column. </p>\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/1g.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The last bulk of my work was fixing the salary column. I had my work set out for me because I could see that it was a \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjumble of salaries, hourly wages, vague descriptions of what their compensation might be, or just other benefits that \r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdidn’t help candidates understand what pay they should be expecting. </p>\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"images/1h.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n-\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I extracted all entries that mentioned “yearly” and “hourly”, and swapped the hourly salaries that were too outrageous\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t to be true to yearly salaries, and vice-versa.
